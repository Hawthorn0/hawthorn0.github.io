                <h2>Looking at making a new game before Crash Chip</h2>
                <p>Before I end up releasing Crash Chip, I'm looking to make a smaller game that I plan on releasing to steam. Here are some reasons for doing this</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>By releasing a smaller, free game on steam first, I can establish a steam presense before Crash Chip to increase sales for Crash Chip</li>
                    <li>I will soon be going to college, where I will learn better game-making techniques for Crash Chip. So instead of working on Crash Chip now I'll work on it as I learn</li>
                    <li>I want to make a new game</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Currently, I am unsure what it will be called, but I've already got ideas for the game. I plan on making it a fastpaced 2d platform with you slowly getting more tools to your kit. Some of these tools will be a grappling hook, a tool which allows you to reel in the grappling hook, a dashpack, and maybe more.</p>
