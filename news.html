                <h2>Making good progress learning stuff</h2>

                <p>After quite a bit of experimentation, I can say I've made good progress learning how to use libraries for making tilemaps. Though it would have been easier in the short run to make my own tilemap system, using one which is dedicated to tilemapping will probably be better in the long run. So far, its going well</p>

                <p>My plan was to just reuse a lot of files from my fighting game for my platformer, however those don't translate as well as I wanted, so that sucks...</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, I will now be posting the name here, just know that its a really cool and awesome name that encompasses the idea of the game really well. At some point I may release it, but for now its a secret.</p>

                <h2>Looking at making a new game before my main game</h2>
                <p>Date posted: 4/11/2024</p>
                <p>Before I end up releasing my main game, I'm looking to make a smaller game that I plan on releasing to steam. Here are some reasons for doing this</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>By releasing a smaller, free game on steam first, I can establish a steam presense before releasing my main game to increase sales for my main game</li>
                    <li>I will soon be going to college, where I will learn better game-making techniques for my main game. So instead of working on my main game now I'll work on it as I learn</li>
                    <li>I want to make a new game</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Currently, I am unsure what it will be called, but I've already got ideas for the game. I plan on making it a fastpaced 2d platform with you slowly getting more tools to your kit. Some of these tools will be a grappling hook, a tool which allows you to reel in the grappling hook, a dashpack, and maybe more.</p>
