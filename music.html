                <ul>
                    <li>Most of my best songs go onto Spotify and other various music streaming services. But the ones that don't can be found here. </li>
                    <li>These are songs that showcase the wider range of what I can do with music. Though, they have less time put into them, as whats found here was probably made in 30 minutes to 2 hours. They're mostly meant to show what styles I can make. </li>
                    <li>That being said, they're still mine. So you may only use these if you get express permission from Hawthorn Wood (Beat Thorn) (Me)</li>
                    <li>Final note, if you're looking for a general idea of my music, just select the "my favorites" tag and look at those songs. </li>
                    <li>Also, the exclusive tag does not work right now. </li>
